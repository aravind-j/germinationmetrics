\details{
Peak value (\mjseqn{PV}) is the maximum quotient obtained by dividing
successive cumulative germination values by the relevant incubation time
\insertCite{czabator_germination_1962}{germinationmetrics}.

\mjsdeqn{PV = \max\left ( \frac{G_{1}}{T_{1}},\frac{G_{2}}{T_{2}},\cdots
\frac{G_{k}}{T_{k}} \right )}

Where, \mjseqn{T_{i}} is the time from the start of the experiment to the
\mjseqn{i}th interval, \mjseqn{G_{i}} is the cumulative germination
percentage in the \mjseqn{i}th time interval, and \mjseqn{k} is the total
number of time intervals.

It represents the mean daily germination of the most vigorous component of
the seed lot, and is a mathematical expression of the break, or shoulder, of
a typical sigmoid  germination curve
\insertCite{djavanshir_germination_1976}{germinationmetrics}. It is the
accumulated number of seeds germinated at the point on the germination curve
at which the rate of germination starts to decrease. It is also described as
Emergence energy \insertCite{bonner_ideal_1967}{germinationmetrics}.

For daily germination counts, germination value (\mjseqn{GV}) is computed as
follows \insertCite{czabator_germination_1962}{germinationmetrics}.

\mjsdeqn{GV = PV \times MDG}

Where, \mjseqn{PV} is the peak value, and \mjseqn{MDG} is the mean daily
germination percentage from the onset of germination.

Germination value (\mjseqn{GV}) can also be computed for other time intervals
of successive germination counts, by replacing \mjseqn{MDG} with the mean
germination percentage per unit time (\mjseqn{\overline{GP}}).

A new estimation of germination value was given by
\insertCite{djavanshir_germination_1976;textual}{germinationmetrics} as
follows.

\mjsdeqn{GV = \frac{\sum DGS}{N} \times GP \times c}

Where, \mjseqn{DGS} is the daily germination speed computed by dividing
cumulative germination percentage by the number of days since the onset of
germination, \mjseqn{N} is the frequency or number of DGS calculated during
the test, \mjseqn{GP} is the germination percentage expressed over 100, and
\mjseqn{c} is a constant. The value of \mjseqn{c} is decided on the basis of
average daily speed of germination (\mjseqn{\frac{\sum DGS}{N}}). If it is
less than 10, then \mjseqn{c} value of 10 can be used and if it is more than
10, then value of 7 or 8 can be used for \mjseqn{c}.

For both methods of computing \mjseqn{GV}, only the duration from the onset
of germination is considered by default. Alternatively, modified \mjseqn{GV}
(\mjseqn{GV_{mod}}), where the entire duration from the beginning of the test
is considered can be obtained by using the argument \code{from.onset = FALSE}
\insertCite{brown_representing_1988}{germinationmetrics}.
