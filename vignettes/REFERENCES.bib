(seaside alder), a large shrub or small tree found naturally in only three small, disjunct populations, have not been studied. We examined effects of population of origin and environment on seed germination and growth and morphology of seedlings. The first experiment showed that 6 weeks of cold stratification optimized germination of half-sibling seeds from Oklahoma at 73.2\%. When this treatment was applied to multiple groups of half-siblings from all populations in a second experiment, seeds from Oklahoma had a higher germination percentage (55.0\%) than seeds from Georgia (31.4\%) and the Delmarva Peninsula (14.7\%). In a third experiment, morphology and growth of multiple groups of half-siblings from all three populations were compared in one environment. Leaves of seedlings from Oklahoma were longer (12.8 cm) and more narrow (2.15 length to width ratio) than leaves of seedlings from Georgia (12.0 cm long; ratio = 1.76) and the Delmarva Peninsula (11.6 cm long; ratio = 1.86). Seedlings from Oklahoma and Georgia accumulated dry weight at higher rates (181 and 160 mg·d-1, respectively) than seedlings from Delmarva (130 mg·d-1), while seedlings from Oklahoma and Delmarva were more densely foliated (0.72 and 0.64 leaves and lateral shoots per centimeter of primary stem, respectively) than those from Georgia (0.46 per cm). These differences indicate genetic divergence among the three disjunct populations and the potential to exploit genetic variation to select horticulturally superior A. maritima for use in managed landscapes.},

As a result a set of conditions has been defined enabling exactly comparable tests to be made in different laboratories. The measured criteria of the test—the mean and standard deviation of the germination time—have been used for studying varietal differences in germination, for assessment of malting quality, for determining the optimum time for the start of malting, for investigating variety × location inter-actions of malting quality, for vigor studies and for the assessment of milling quality of wheat. This series of investigations has shown that the germination resistance test offers a simple, cheap reproducible method of measuring the germination characteristics of cereals. It has also shown that much useful information regarding the germination of cereals, not normally obtained from germinability tests can be gained. This sensitive technique can thus be used to study the effect of all external agencies on the germination of small grain cereals and with modifications in the moisture supply should also be adaptable to other non-gramineous seeds.]},

The mechanisms of seed dormancy, of the breaking of seed dormancy and of germination itself continue to remain shrouded in mystery, despite the best efforts of plant scientists. Perhaps we are getting there, but very slowly. This book considers germination and dormancy from the point of view of plant physiology. Plant physiologists attempt to understand the relation­ ship between plant form and function and to explain, in physical and chemical terms, plant growth and development. The place of germination and dormancy in plant ecophysiology is taken into account with attempts to understand the seed in its 'environment, whether the environment be natural, semi-natural or wholly artificial. In due course plant scientists hope to develop a precise understanding of germination and dormancy in cellular and molecular terms, and therefore there is some biochemistry in this book. Biochemists who wish to learn something about seeds should find this book useful.},

	abstract = {SummaryGermination of Amaranthus caudatus is inhibited by light, far-red being the most effective part of the spectrum. At temperatures of 25° and below there is a low final germination percentage under continuous far-red whereas above 25° there is only a delaying effect. In the presence of a saturating concentration of gibberellic acid (GA3) at 25° seeds germinate under continuous far-red although they are delayed. At 25° seeds exposed to 48 hr far-red fail to germinate when transferred to darkness. This induced dormancy can be broken by a single short exposure to red light given at any time after the far-red illumination. This effect of short red can be reversed by a subsequent short period of far-red indicating that the seeds are phytochrome controlled. Although most seeds have escaped from the reversing effect of short far-red after an intervening dark period of 5 hours, germination is greatly reduced by continuous far-red at this time. Results of exposing seeds to varying periods of far-red before and after dark imbibition are interpreted in terms of a continual production of phytochrome in its active P fr form and a requirement for P fr action over a long period of time. Effects of intermittent and continuous low intensity far-red on the inhibition of germination provides further evidence for a low energy photoreaction involving phytochrome. Effects on Germination Index of continuous illumination with various light sources maintaining different P fr /P total ratios have been investigated. The results suggest that the proportion of phytochrome in the P fr form is the most important factor in the regulation of germination. A scheme for the phytochrome control of germination in Amaranthus caudatus is presented and possible explanations for the dependence on P fr /P total ratio are discussed.},

We consider experiments where germination in response to time elapsed is used to characterize germination performance and vigour. We formulate statistical models in a biologically meaningful framework in such a way that the inherent data structure, which centers around repeatedly monitoring seeds over time, is duly incorporated in the statistical analysis. Consequently, estimation and model checking procedures are based on treating the data as event times, that is, to record the time it takes for germination (the event of interest) to occur. The key result is that the use of appropriate statistical models is important in order to get a better appreciation of the uncertainty that is present in germination experiments.},

	abstract = {IN reporting experiments with biological processes such as abscission, germination, and dormancy, where results are observed and recorded periodically, most investigators have found it convenient to present the data as time-course curves. While time-course curves such as those shown for abscission in Fig. 1 are useful in indicating the initiation and the total amount of abscission, as well as the slope of the response curves (rate), they cannot readily be compared numerically. For comparison of the results of large numbers of treatments in individual experiments, or of groups of experiments, and for statistical analyses, numerical designations are necessary. The time required for 50 or 100 per cent abscission and the percentage abscission at an arbitrary time after treatment are designations commonly used. Neither of these methods allows a satisfactory comparison of data frequently encountered in research. For example, comparison of the data represented by curves 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1 on the basis of the time to 50 or 100 per cent abscission is impossible as not all the curves reach either of these levels by the end of the experiment. This problem is intensified when treatments retard or inhibit abscission. Furthermore, the relationship of the curves changes with time, and thus comparison of the percentage abscission at an arbitrary time represents only a small part of the information in the curve.},

	abstract = {Slow establishment of perennial warm-season forage grasses is a problem in their utilization to improve animal production in summer when cool-season grasses are less productive. A field experiment was conducted to determine temperature effects on field emergence, estimate base temperature required for emergence in the field, and provide insight toward optimum planting dates for warm-season perennial forage grasses. Big bluestem (BB) (Andropogon gerardiiVitman), Causasian bluestem (CB) [Bothriochloa caucasica(Trin.) C. E. Hubb.], indiangrass (IG) [Sorghartrum nutans(L.) Nash], switchgrass (SG) (Panicum virgatumL.), and an annual species, crabgrass (CG) [Digitaria sanguinalis(L.) Scop.] were compared in a split-plot field experiment with five replications. Unchilled seeds of each species were planted at approximately 2-week intervals in a Mexico silt loam soil (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Udollic Ochraqualf) near Columbia, MO from early April to late June in 1982 and 1983. Emerging seedlings were recorded frequently. The logistic function was used to fit the emergence data. No emergence data were obtained for CG since natural emergence also occurred. Maximum emergence percentage was obtained following planting on 30 Apr. and 2 June 1982, and 6 and 16 May 1983. Indiangrass had the highest emergence percentages of pure live seed with 38 and 51\% in 1982 and 1983, respectively, followed by SG, BB, and CB. Survival percentage of emerged seedlings averaged about 90\%, but was reduced to near 70\% on late plantings when soil dried out rapidly. Entries with high emergence percentages also had their highest emergence rates (ER) at Et50(time to reach 50\% of final emergence). Corrected ER index and ER50(reciprocal of Et50) were closely correlated (r= 0.99, P{<}0.01). Both are good indices for evaluating speed of emergence. However, ER50is based on actual measurements and has more agronomic significance and biological meaning. Base temperatures required for emergence in 1982 were estimated as 9.4, 9.9, 10.8, and 11.4 °C for IG, BB, SG, and CB, respectively. For 1983 temperatures were 10.0, 10.8, 10.4, and 9.5 °C, respectively. The data suggest optimum planting dates for these species between late April and mid-May to maximize emergence percentage and reduce risks of high temperature and soil moisture stress.},

Maximum increase in soil temperature occurred under transparent polyethylene cover. Temperature alterations were relatively smaller under other treatments and was minimum under farm yard manure cover. With both sowings, the effect of various ways of soil covering on seedling emergence depended on the magnitude of soil temperature alteration caused by them. It was hastened markedly under transparent polyethylene cover and only slightly under black polyethylene cover. Continuous soil covering with rice straw slowed down seedling emergence while covering only during night hastened it slightly. Farm yard manure cover showed negligible effect on seedling emergence. Seedling emergence response to an increase in soil temperature was higher with second sowing when temperature was relatively lower than with first sowing. The result suggests the possibility of expediting seedling emergence of wheat sown under low temperature condition by transparent polyethylene cover. Seedling emergence was only slightly influenced by other soil covers.},

	abstract = {A method for mathematically describing cumulative seed germination using the four-parameter Hill function is described. The function's four parameters allowed both direct or indirect biological interpretation of germination behavior and the impact of seed pretreatments on germination improvement. Three parameters, a, b, and c, allowed direct assessment of germination capacity (\%), the shape and steepness of the germination course, and germination speed (time to reach 50\% germination). The fourth parameter y0 permitted estimation of the lag time (germination onset). The mathematical expression of cumulative seed germination of unstratified and stratified seed made it possible to quantitatively estimate seedlot dormancy and the amount of germination improvement caused by a specific seed pretreatment. This was accomplished by estimating the area between the two cumulative germination curves through integration. The utility of the proposed approach was demonstrated using germination data from wind-pollinated, individual genotypes (half-sib families) of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and bulk seedlots of lodgepole pine and white spruce (Picea glauca).},

Stratifying common milkweed seed in water at 5 C was more effective in breaking dormancy than at 22 C. Mechanical scarification also caused a significant increase in germination. Exogenous 6-furfurylamino purine (kinetin) and gibberellic acid-3 (GA) increased germination while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had no effect. The optimum germination temperature scheme for common milkweed was an alternating 20 to 30 C, the maximum between 35 and 40 C, and the minimum between 15 and 20 C. Common milkweed seedlings were more susceptible to moisture stress than kochia [Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.] but less susceptible than hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). In a greenhouse study common milkweed was less drought tolerant than eight other weed species. Common milkweed seedlings tolerated wider pH ranges than honeyvine milkweed [Ampelamus albidus (Nutt.) Britt.], kochia, and sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings were less tolerant to salt solutions than four other species. Common milkweed emerged from 6-cm depths in Sharpsburg silty clay loam (sicl) at 20 or 30 C but only from the 3-cm depth at an alternating 20 to 30 C. Results from root box studies showed that common and honeyvine milkweed produced less shoot and root weight than kochia and sunflower and had a lower growth rate index of roots than sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings resprouted 21 days after planting when clipped at ground level. As days from planting to clipping increased, sprouting activity increased.},

	abstract = {Seeds are increasingly being stored in seed banks for ex situ conservation, food security, and restoration reserves. Although it is hypothesized that seeds of many species can survive the dry, freezer conditions (−20°C) of seed banks for many years, shelf life is unknown for many species. In particular, changes to dormancy and germination requirements following freezer storage have not yet been studied extensively. To improve our understanding of how seed dormancy and germination respond to seed banking conditions, we evaluated seed of six restoration-priority species in the southwestern United States, which is a region of increasing restoration need. Germination tendencies of seeds that were and were not exposed to a −20°C treatment for 4–6 months were evaluated under 22 cold-moist stratification and incubation treatments to broadly assess changes to dormancy and germination requirements and speed. Direct or indirect (via interactions with stratification and/or incubation treatments) differences in dormancy breaking and germination were observed in seeds for four of the six species studied. Specifically, storage temperature accounted for differences in the final germination proportion, germination during stratification, and/or rate of germination in five of the six species. Notably, seeds of the one species that exhibit a combination of physiological and physical dormancy showed significant differences in all germination measures. However, while significant differences were found between seeds exposed to short-term seed bank storage and those that were not, these differences were small and may not be biologically meaningful, indicating that seed banking these species should not change how they are used for restoration or reintroduction purposes.},

	abstract = {Germination data are analyzed by several methods, which can be mainly classified as germination indexes and traditional regression techniques to fit non-linear parametric functions to the temporal sequence of cumulative germination. However, due to the nature of germination data, often different from other biological data, the abovementioned methods may present some limits, especially when ungerminated seeds are present at the end of an experiment. A class of methods that could allow addressing these issues is represented by the so-called “time-to-event analysis”, better known in other scientific fields as “survival analysis” or “reliability analysis”. There is relatively little literature about the application of these methods to germination data, and some reviews dealt only with parts of the possible approaches such as either non-parametric and semi-parametric or parametric ones. The present study aims to give a contribution to the knowledge about the reliability of these methods by assessing all the main approaches to the same germination data provided by sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) seeds cohorts. The results obtained confirmed that although the different approaches present advantages and disadvantages, they could generally represent a valuable tool to analyze germination data providing parameters whose usefulness depends on the purpose of the research.},

However, weed scientists face practical problems in determining the best soil depth at which to calculate it. Two different types of measures are proposed for this: moment-based indices and probability density-based indices. Due to the monitoring process, it is not possible to observe the exact emergence time of every seedling; therefore, emergence times are not observed individually, seedling by seedling, but in an aggregated way. To address these facts, some new methods to estimate the proposed indices are derived, using grouped data estimators and kernel density estimators. The proposed methods have been exemplified with an emergence data set of Bromus diandrus. The results indicate that hydrothermal timing at 50 mm is more useful than that at 10 mm.},

The asymptotic bias and variance of the proposed estimator are derived under usual assumptions, and the effect of using non-equally spaced grouped data is analysed. Additionally, a plug-in bandwidth selector is proposed. Through a comprehensive simulation study, the behaviour of both the estimator and the plug-in bandwidth selector considering different scenarios of data grouping is shown. An application to real data confirms the simulation results, revealing the good performance of the estimator whenever data are not heavily grouped.},

A plug-in bandwidth selector is proposed and its relative rate of convergence obtained. Additionally, a bootstrap algorithm to select the bandwidth in this framework is designed. This method is easy to implement and does not require Monte Carlo. Both proposals are compared through simulations in different scenarios. It is observed that when the sample size is medium or large and grouping is not heavy, both bandwidth selection methods have a similar and good performance. However, when the sample size is large and under heavy grouping scenarios, the bootstrap bandwidth selector leads to better results.},

Mean squared error and correlation results indicated higher accuracy for the descriptive ability but similar poor performance for predictive ability of the nonparametric approach in comparison with the PNR approach. These results suggest that our nonparametric cumulative distribution function approach is a valuable alternative to the classical parametric nonlinear regression models to describe complex emergence patterns for P. paradoxa, but not to predict them.},

Germination at suboptimal \emph{T} can be characterized on the basis of thermal time, or the \emph{T} in excess of a base (\emph{T$_{\textrm{b}}$}) multiplied by the time to a given percentage germination (\emph{t$_{\textrm{g}}$}). Similarly, germination at reduced ψ can be characterized on a hydrotime basis, or the ψ in excess of a base (ψ$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$) multiplied by \emph{t$_{\textrm{g}}$}. Within a seed population, the variation in thermal times to germination for a specific percentage (\emph{g}) is based upon the normal distribution of ψ$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$ values among seeds (ψ$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$(\emph{g})). Germination responses across a range of suboptimal \emph{T} and ψ might be accounted for by a general hydrothermal time model incorporating both \emph{T} and ψ components. We tested this hypothesis for tomato (\emph{Lycopersicon esculentum} Mill.) seeds of two genotypes differing in germination rates and tolerance of suboptimal \emph{T} and ψ. For combinations of \emph{T} (10−25°C) and ψ (0 to −0.9 MPa), a general hydrothermal time model accounted for approximately 75\% of the variation in times to germination within the seed populations of both genotypes, and over 96\% of the variation in median germination rates. However, ψ$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$(\emph{g}) distributions were sensitive to both the \emph{T} and ψ of imbibition, resulting in a poor fit of the model to specific time course data. Analysis of germination timing separately for low and high ψ ranges within a given \emph{T} resulted in specific models accounting for 88−99\% of the variation in individual germination times and \&gt;99\% of the variation in madian germination rates. Thus, for a given \emph{T} and ψ range, the hydrotime model closely matched tomato seed germination time courses. Accumulated hydrothermal time accounted well for germination rates at ψ\&gt; −0.5 MPa across suboptimal \emph{T} if ψ$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$(\emph{g}) was allowed to vary with \emph{T}. Germination did not show a consistent response to \emph{T} at ψ \&lt; −0.5 MPa, and estimated \emph{T}$_{\textrm{\emph{b}}}$ values varied over different \emph{T} ranges. Generalization of the hydrothermal time model across the entire range of suboptimal \emph{T} and ψ was limited by physiological adjustments of the seeds to their current environment. The hydrothermal time model detected and quantified these adjustment processes that would otherwise not be evident from inspection of germination time courses. Temperature and water potential influence the time to germination via physiological mechanisms that reciprocally interact.},

	abstract = {Coolatai grass is an invasive, perennial grass from Africa and the Middle East that has infested large areas of northern New South Wales, Australia, and also occurs in other Australian states. An understanding of the seed germination ecology of Coolatai grass can assist in predicting its potential distribution and developing effective management strategies. The effects of various environmental factors on Coolatai grass seed germination were investigated in a series of laboratory experiments. The effect of diurnal alternating temperatures (5–45 C) with a 12-h photoperiod were examined on a thermogradient plate. Seed germination occurred at almost all temperature combinations from 5 to 45 C. At moderate temperatures the speed of seed germination was very high; at 30/20 C more than 80\% of seeds were germinated within 12 h. Germination was slightly enhanced by the presence of light, but length of photoperiod did not affect germination. Germination at neutral pH was over 90\%, and declined to 65\% at acidic (pH 4) and alkaline (pH 10) pH levels. Germination was completely inhibited at an osmotic stress of −0.55 MPa or greater and was reduced by 50\% at −0.37 MPa. Greater germination in relatively dry soil conditions compared with native species may contribute to the establishment of this species in the field. Results indicate that Coolatai grass seeds can germinate over a wide range of diurnal temperatures, light regimes, pH levels, and under marginal water stress. These characteristics help explain the successful invasion of Coolatai grass and provide evidence that this species is capable of establishing in many parts of Australia.},

In general, germination data conformed to the hydrothermal model. Departures from the model were encountered for slow-germinating seeds at suboptimal temperatures ({<}span class="italic"{>}T{<}/span{>}\&nbsp;≤\&nbsp;20°C). To account for these departures, two alternative hydrothermal models were fitted with an additional term for an upwards shift in seed base water potential with increasing time to germination. The alternative models more correctly predicted germination time than the original model. Similarly, reduced percentage germination at supra-optimal temperatures ({<}span class="italic"{>}T{<}/span{>}\&gt;20°C) was explained by including a term in the hydrothermal model which shifted the base water potential of seeds upwards towards zero, which in turn reduced the predicted rate that hydrothermal time would be accumulated by seeds. The rate of this upwards shift in base water potential was dependent on time to complete germination and ambient water potential as well as supra-optimal temperature.},

	abstract = {As seed dormancy is released within a seed population, both the rate and percentage of germination increase progressively with increasing dose of a dormancy-breaking treatment or condition. Population-based models can account for this behaviour on the basis of shifting response thresholds as dormancy is alleviated. In particular, hydrothermal time analysis of germination sensitivity to water potential (Ψ) and temperature ({<}span class="italic"{>}T{<}/span{>}) can describe these features of seed behaviour. We used the hydrothermal time model to analyse the effects of dormancy-breaking treatments on germination of dormant true (botanical) potato ({<}span class="italic"{>}Solanum tuberosum{<}/span{>} L.) seeds (TPS). After-ripening (37°C and 4\% seed moisture content) of TPS for 7 or 30 days partially or fully alleviated primary dormancy. The median base water potential required to prevent germination [Ψ{<}span class="sub"{>}b{<}/span{>}(50)] decreased from –0.25 MPa in control seeds to –0.87 MPa and –1.83 MPa after 7 and 30 days of after-ripening, respectively. In contrast, the base temperature for germination ({<}span class="italic"{>}T{<}/span{>}{<}span class="sub"{>}b{<}/span{>}) was relatively unaffected (0–3.3°C). Fluridone (50 μM), an inhibitor of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, also promoted germination of dormant TPS and lowered Ψ{<}span class="sub"{>}b{<}/span{>}(50), indicating a role for {<}span class="italic"{>}de novo{<}/span{>} synthesis of ABA during dormancy maintenance. Moist chilling (3 days at 4°C) or gibberellin (100 μM) alleviated secondary dormancy and lowered Ψ{<}span class="sub"{>}b{<}/span{>}(50) values from –0.08 MPa to –0.36 and –0.87 MPa, respectively. The hydrothermal time model allows quantification of dormancy levels and explains why changes in germination speed and percentage are closely correlated during dormancy alleviation.},

To test these hypotheses, incubator studies were conducted using seeds and seedlings of common lambsquarters. Probit analysis was used to account for variation in cardinal temperatures and base water potentials and to develop parameters for a new mathematical model that describes seed germination and shoot and radicle elongation in terms of hydrothermal time and temperature, respectively.

	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0≤t 1ǐ≤t 2ǐ≤ … ≤t N ǐ. Then P(t)= II. [(N – r)/(N – r + 1)], where r assumes those values for which tr ≤t and for which tr ǐ measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors. * Prepared while the authors were at Bell Telephone Laboratories and Johns Hopkins University respectively.

Within a seed population the variation in time to germination arises from variation in Ψb(g) modelled by a normal distribution. We tested the assumption of normality in the distribution of Ψb(g) by germinating seed of two unrelated species with non-dormant seed (Buddleja davidii (Franch.) and Pinus radiata D. Don) across a range of constant Ψ at sub-optimal T. When incorporated into a HTT model the Weibull distribution more accurately described both the right skewed distribution of Ψb(g) and germination time course over sub-optimal T than the HTT based on the normal distribution, for both species. Given the flexibility of the Weibull distribution this model not only provides a useful method for predicting germination but also a means of determining the distribution of Ψb(g).},

Only two temperature-controlled facilities, a test period of about a month and a relatively small number of sample seeds arc needed to obtain information on the thermal-germination parameters of individual seed populations, such as lower or higher limit temperatures, and thermal times required for germination. In the test system, the germination performances of sample seed populations were compared under two temperature regimes: a gradually increasing temperature regime and a gradually decreasing temperature regime, in which the seeds were subjected to gradually changing temperatures in the range of 4 36°C. In order to assess the effects of various values for thermal-germination parameters on the patterns of germination performance in the system, the behaviour of model seeds characterized by a definite set of thermal germination parameters were investigated. Referring to the results of the simulations, the actual germination patterns of some wild-seed populations in the test system were interpreted in terms of thermal-germination parameters.},

This differs from existing models that describe the effects of fixed water potentials on germination, or the effects of fixed priming water potentials on the subsequent germination at a fixed water potential. When a seed is sown, the virtual osmotic potential is assumed to fall at a rate that depends on the ambient water potential, and on the difference between its current and a minimum value. Radicle growth is assumed to initiate when the difference between the ambient water potential and the virtual osmotic potential exceeds a threshold. The germination of carrot and onion seeds at various fixed potentials below 0 MPa was well described by the virtual osmotic potential model. The model was also used to simulate the results of experiments in which seeds were given a single step change in water potential.},

	abstract = {A model was developed to simulate weed emergence patterns after soil cultivation. In the model, the consecutive processes of dormancy release, germination and pre-emergence growth were modelled in separate modules. Input variables of the model were: date of soil cultivation, soil temperature and soil penetration resistance. Output variables of the model were: seedling density and timing of seedling emergence. The model was parameterized for Polygonum persicaria, Chenopodium album and Spergula arvensis with data from previous field and laboratory experiments. The model was evaluated with data from an experiment, in which emergence of P. persicaria, C. album and S. arvensis was monitored in field plots that were cultivated once only, at one of five dates in the spring. At the same time as the field observations on seedling emergence, seasonal changes in seed dormancy of the buried weed seeds were assessed by testing the germination of seed lots that were buried in envelopes. From a comparison between field observations and simulated data, it appeared that the model overestimated the rate of dormancy release in spring, whereas germination and pre-emergence growth were simulated well. In general, therefore, both the numbers of emerging seedlings and the timing of emergence could be predicted accurately, when dormancy was not simulated but introduced from experimental data. Improvement of predictions of field emergence of weeds should mainly focus on increasing the precision of the simulation of dormancy release. Close correlations were found between seedbed temperature and both the extent and rate of seedling emergence, but analysis with the simulation model revealed that they were only partly based on causal relationships, so that they have limited predictive value.},

Doubts were raised about the unquestioning description of rate temperature relationships by straight lines and the subsequent extrapolation of base temperatures from them. An alternative method where base temperatures are estimated from final percentage germination is suggested. This removes the linearity constraint from the rate temperature relationship and should have better predictive properties at low temperatures. An advantage of the method is that it predicts both the timing and percentage of seeds which will germinate in a given time interval. Thus it provides a unifying hypothesis which may aid interpretation of results from alternating temperature studies. Generalization of the method to include water potential is described and the methods are illustrated with several data sets.},

There are problems with these approaches, including loss of information, and censoring and lack of independence in the germination data. Model estimation may require optimization, and this can have a heavy computational burden. Here, we compare non-linear regression with survival and Bayesian methods, to estimate HTT models for germination of two clover species. All three methods estimated similar HTT model parameters with similar root mean squared errors. However, the Bayesian approach allowed (1) efficient estimation of model parameters without the need for computation-intensive methods and (2) easy comparison of HTT parameters for the two clover species. HTT models that accounted for a species effect were superior to those that did not. Inspection of credibility intervals and estimated posterior distributions for the Bayesian HTT model shows that it is credible that most HTT model parameters were different for the two clover species, and these differences were consistent with known biological differences between species in their germination behaviour.},

Because of phytosanitary restrictions to exports, pineapple producers must use a zero tolerance level for this species. An understanding of itchgrass seedling emergence would help producers to better time POST control. The objective of the present study was to characterize itchgrass seedling emergence patterns and develop a predictive model. Multiple field experiments were conducted in four agricultural fields in Costa Rica between 2010 and 2011 for a total of 9 site-years. Itchgrass consistently showed a biphasic emergence pattern, with a first emergence phase that was faster and more consistent across site-years than the second one. Weibull logistic models based on chronological time (R2adj = 0.92) and thermal time with Tbase = 20 C (R2adj = 0.92) provided the best fit for the combined emergence data for two experimental locations in 2010. Both models predicted itchgrass seedling emergence adequately for most site-years, but the thermal-time model was more accurate (R2adj = 0.64 to 0.86) than the chronological model (R2adj = 0.31 to 0.74), especially when temperatures were high. Both models showed high accuracy in the first emergence phase but tended to underestimate emergence rate during the second phase. The models predicted 50\% emergence at 14 d or 80 growing degree days and the stabilization of the first emergence phase at approximately 25 d or 200 growing degree days. Thus, these models can be used to properly time itchgrass POST control. More research is needed to understand the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the variability of the second emergence phase.Nomenclature: Itchgrass, Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) W.D.

	abstract = {Hydrothermal time (HTT) models have been widely applied to describe the germination responses of seeds to temperature and water. Some HTT models assume that the thermoinhibition of germination is caused by an upward shift in base water potential Ψb(g) that only happens above the optimum temperature To, and that To is a parameter independent of the water stress level. However, the available data suggest that these assumptions may be invalid in practice. We introduce a new HTT model that uses a log-logistic distribution for Ψb(g) and assumes a linear increase in Ψb(g) across both sub- and supra-optimal temperature ranges. We also provide explicit mathematical solutions for estimating To and other cardinal temperatures within a HTT modelling framework. Germination data were obtained for two winter annual plant species (Hordeum spontaneum and Phalaris minor) and used to build and test the model. For both species, the linear upward shift in Ψb(g) was confirmed across both sub-and supra-optimal ranges, while the hydrotime constant θH decreased nonlinearly with temperature. This interplay between θH and Ψb(g) resulted in a curvilinear germination rate response to temperature that accounts for thermoinhibition of germination at high temperatures. The optimal temperature decreased proportionally with decreasing water potential and became cooler for higher (slower) germination fractions than for the lower (faster) ones. The new modelling approach not only gave good fits to germination data (with root mean square errors {<}10\%), but also provided useful insights about the adaptive strategies evolved by plant species to optimize their germination timing under the various temperature and moisture environments.},

	abstract = {Probit models for estimating hydrothermal germination rate yield model parameters that have been associated with specific physiological processes. The desirability of linking germination response to seed physiology must be weighed against expectations of model fit and the relative accuracy of predicted germination response. Computationally efficient empirical models have been proposed that do not require a priori assumptions about model shape parameters, but the accuracy of these models has not been compared to the more common probit-optimization procedure. Thirteen seedlots, representing six native perennial rangeland grasses and an invasive annual weed, were germinated over the constant temperature range of 3 to 36°C and water potential range of 0 to -2.5 MPa. Hydrothermal germination models were generated using probit optimization, optimized regression, and statistical gridding. These models were evaluated for the pattern and magnitude of residual model error and the relative magnitude of predictive errors under field-simulated temperature and moisture conditions. Residual model errors in predictions of germination rate were greatest for the probit optimization procedure. Statistical gridding and optimized regression produced lower predictive model error, but the latter procedure could not resolve germination response for slower-germinating seed populations. The more computationally efficient and accurate regression and statistical-gridding procedures may be desirable for identifying germination strategies and syndromes that are based on predicted response to simulated conditions of field temperature and moisture.},

The model was calibrated for different types of soil by adjusting the base temperature of common lambsquarters seedling emergence to the soil texture. A relationship was established with the sand mineral fraction of the soil and was integrated into the model. The calibrated model provided a good fit of the field data and was accurate in predicting cumulative weed emergence in different soil types. The validation was done using data collected independently at a site located 80 km from the original experimental area. There were no differences between observed and predicted values. The accuracy of the model is very satisfactory because the emergence of common lambsquarters populations was accurately predicted at the 95\% probability level. This model is one of the first to take into consideration seedbed preparation time and soil texture. This common lambsquarters emergence model could be adapted to model other weed species whose emergence is limited by low spring temperature.},

The analysis involved the concept of hydrothermal time which is a combination of potential above a base potential, temperature above a base temperature and time. For most of the population of sugar-beet seeds examined, the hydrothermal time required for germination was constant. The base temperatures of the seeds were similar but the base potentials varied between seeds. Analysis of the times to germination of fractions of the seed population, grouped according to the order in which they germinated, showed that the base potentials were almost normally distributed An equation using this distribution can be used to predict the time course of germination over a wide range of temperatures and potentials. The equation uses five parameters to describe a seed population: the proportion of live seeds, the hydrothermal time required for germination, the base temperature and the mean and standard deviation of base potential.},

	abstract = {The time required for germination increases prior to the loss of viability as seeds deteriorate during storage. We have developed a population-based threshold model that can quantify and predict seed germination times and percentages after various ageing periods under constant conditions. The model assumes that each seed has a maximum potential lifetime, the values of which vary in a normal distribution among individual seeds, and that the time to germination of a particular seed is inversely proportional to the remaining difference between the accumulated ageing period and the maximum lifetime of that seed. This model described with reasonable accuracy the germination time-courses of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds after increasing periods of controlled deterioration at 10\% moisture content (fresh weight basis) and 40 °C. In seeds of high initial quality, two phases of deterioration were detected, a relatively slow phase before significant loss of viability occurred and a more rapid phase once viability began to decline. Prehydration and redrying treatments that shortened the time to germination also reduced or eliminated the initial lag phase before the loss of viability began. Seed germination rates after different ageing periods can be normalized on a common ‘ageing-time’ scale, emphasizing the continuous and progressive nature of deteriorative processes in seeds. The model predicted, and the data confirmed, that there was a critical imbibition time after which no additional normal seedlings would germinate. This critical imbibition time for a given seed lot was independent of the ageing period. The maximum lifetime threshold model, in conjunction with previous population-based models of seed viability during storage, can provide a quantitative description of seed germination rates and normal or abnormal seedling percentages throughout the storage life of a seed lot.},

	abstract = {Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) is an annual weed frequently found in winter crops and increasingly tolerant to herbicides. To manage this weed with less or no herbicides, the model ALOMYSYS was developed to quantify the effects of cropping systems on the demography of blackgrass. The sub-model for seed survival, dormancy, germination and pre-emergent growth was described in a previous paper. This paper presents the sub-model quantifying seedling survival, tillering, heading, flowering and seed production, as a function of the weed emergence date and density (predicted by the seed bank sub-model), the crops grown in the field, the cultivation techniques used to manage the crop (tillage, sowing, herbicides, nitrogen, harvest) and the climate (temperature, rainfall). The sub-model is based on the annual life-cycle of blackgrass; the relationship between the various life-stages depends on the model input variables and on the characteristics of the weed population (e.g. tillering decreases with weed density, herbicide efficacy decreases with plant stage and density, etc.). The equations describing the life-stages and processes were deduced from previous greenhouse experiments and field trials. The resulting model was evaluated by comparing the simulations to independent field observations. This validation showed the model to accurately predict weed stages for a given year as well as the dynamics over the years, in contrasted cropping systems. The model can thus be used to evaluate and design new cropping systems for integrated crop protection.},

In analogy with thermal time, hydrotime is the accumulated ψ units (MPa) above a base or threshold value (ψb) multiplied by the time of imbibition at that ψ. The germination rate (inverse of time to radicle emergence) increases linearly as the seed ψ increases above ψb. As ψb values vary among individual seeds, the amount by which the ψ exceeds ψb also varies among seeds, resulting in the typical right-skewed sigmoid germination time courses. Factors which influence seed germination kinetics alter the mean ψb of the seed lot, with higher (more positive) values resulting in an inhibition of germination or imposition of dormancy and lower (more negative) values being associated with rapid germination and high vigour. The induction or alleviation of dormancy involves physiological shifts in the ψb distribution, allowing a seed population to track both long-term and short-term environmental conditions to enhance seedling survival.},

	abstract = {Seed germination culminates in the initiation of embryo growth and the resumption of water uptake after imbibition. Previous applications of cell growth models to describe seed germination have focused on the inhibition of radicle growth rates at reduced water potential (Ψ). An alternative approach is presented, based upon the timing of radicle emergence, to characterize the relationship of seed germination rates to Ψ. Using only three parameters, a `hydrotime constant' and the mean and standard deviation in minimum or base Ψ among seeds in the population, germination time courses can be predicted at any Ψ, or normalized to a common time scale equal to that of seeds germinating in water. The rate of germination of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv Empire) seeds, either intact or with the endosperm envelope cut, increased linearly with embryo turgor. The endosperm presented little physical resistance to radicle growth at the time of radicle emergence, but its presence markedly delayed germination. The length of the lag period after imbibition before radicle emergence is related to the time required for weakening of the endosperm, and not to the generation of additional turgor in the embryo. The rate of endosperm weakening is sensitive to Ψ or turgor.},

	abstract = {Knowledge and prediction of seasonal weed seedling emergence patterns is useful in weed management programs. Seed dormancy is a major factor influencing the timing of seedling emergence, and once dormancy is broken, environmental conditions determine the rate of germination and seedling emergence. Seed dormancy is a population-based phenomenon, because individual seeds are independently sensing their environment and responding physiologically to the signals they perceive. Mathematical models based on characterizing the variation that occurs in germination times among individual seeds in a population can describe and quantity environmental and after-ripening effects on seed dormancy. In particular, the hydrothermal time model can describe and quantify the effects of temperature and water potential on seed germination. This model states that the time to germination of a given seed fraction is inversely proportional to the amount by which a given germination factor (e.g., temperature or water potential) exceeds a threshold level for that factor. The hydrothermal time model provides a robust method for understanding how environmental factors interact to result in the germination phenotype (i.e., germination pattern over time) of a seed population. In addition, other factors that influence seed dormancy and germination act by causing the water potential thresholds of the seed population to shift to higher or lower values. This relatively simple model can describe and quantify the germination behavior of seeds across a wide array of environmental conditions and dormancy states, and can be used as an input to more general models of seed germination and seedling emergence in the field.},

	abstract = {Seed germination has been modeled extensively using hydrothermal time (HTT) models. Generally, a normal distribution for base water potential ψb(g)and a linear upward shift in ψb(g)with increasing temperature were used within these models to relate variation in ψb(g)to the variation in time to germination of a given fraction of seeds. However, little research has tested these assumptions. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to test the assumption of normality in the distribution of ψb(g)by germinating zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) seed with non-dormant seed across a range of constant ψ at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures. Zucchini seeds were incubated at six constant temperature regimes (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 37 °C) at each of the following osmotic potentials (0, −0.15, −0.30, −0.45, and −0.60 MPa). Results indicate that when incorporated into an HTT model, the Weibull distribution (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 11.89) more accurately described ψb(g)and germination course over sub- and supra-optimal temperatures than HTT based on a normal distribution (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 14.80). According to these models, base temperature and base water potential for the 50th percentile (ψb(50)) were estimated at 9.38 °C for both models and −1.27 and −1.31 MPa by the normal and Weibull distribution, respectively. Given the flexibility of the Weibull distribution this model not only provides a useful method for predicting germination but also a means for determining the distribution of ψb(g).},

Within a seed population, the variation in thermal times to germination among different seed fractions (g) is based on a normal distribution of yb values among seeds (yb(g)). Germination responses across a range of suboptimal T and y can be described by a general hydrothermal time model that combines the T and y components, but this model does not account for the decrease in germination rates and percentages when T exceeds To. We report here that supra-optimal temperatures shift the ψb(g) distribution of a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) seed population to more positive values, explaining why both germination rates and percentages are reduced as T increases above To. A modified hydrothermal time model incorporating changes in ψb(g) at T {>} To describes germination timing and percentage across all T and ψ at which germination can occur and provides physiologically relevant indices of seed behaviour.},

	abstract = {The use of seeds with high physiological quality allows rapid growth and establishment of seedlings in the field to be obtained. Therefore, the accuracy of the information obtained during the determination of the physiological quality of seeds is of great importance. The objective was to use generalized linear models, investigating which link function (Probit, Logit and Complementary log-log) is suitable to predict T50 and uniformity during germination of soybean and corn seeds. To perform the experiments, we used seeds from five commercial hybrids and/or cultivars of corn and soybean. The germination speed was calculated by counting the germinated seeds and the results were expressed in the form of proportions. Germination uniformity was calculated by the difference in the times required for germination. The best model was selected according to the criteria of the test of Deviance, AIC and BIC. The Logit model showed accurate results for most cultivars. The evaluation of germination in the form of proportions considering the assumption of binomial response is satisfactory, and the choice of the link function is dependent on the characteristics of each lot and/or species evaluated. The use of this methodology makes it possible to estimate any germination time and uniformity.},

The fitting of the generalized Richards function to germination data by using two nested iterative and least squares regression procedures to estimate the four parameters (all of which can be associated with features of biological growth) is demonstrated. The program also involves a procedure of parallel curve analysis which makes comparisons between two curves by examining the whole process represented by the curve and not just a point or portion thereof. Excellent agreement between observed and expected values was obtained by analyzing data which defined patterns of germination exhibiting a range of rates and final percentages. The program also calculates a number of derived quantities including maximum daily rate of germination and time to 50\% of final germination.},

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to describe germination rates, but most are limited in statistical analysis and biological meaning of indices. Therefore, a mathematical model is proposed to utilize the logistic function. The function was defined as an overall response including time, temperature, and the interaction between time and temperature. Cumulative germination percentages over time were used to develop the model.Germination tests were conducted on indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash) strain ‘IG-2C-F1’, at constant temperatures of 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. The function fitted the observed data over six temperatures at r2 = 0.99. Time to reach 10\% of final germination (Gt10) increased from 2.5 d at 30 °C to 44.0 d at 9 °C, and Gt50 (time to reach 50\% of final germination) increased from 3.6 d at 30 °C to 53.8 d at 9 °C. True germination rate (\% d−1) for each temperature was maximum at Gt50. A linear model of 1/Gt50 versus temperature was used to estimate the base temperature of 8.3 °C for germination. An Arrhenius plot indicated a change occurred between 20 °C and 25 °C for temperature response of germination. Published data on hypocotyl growth of Cucumis melo L. were recalculated using the model. Absolute growth rates showed a temperature response similar to the published weighted-mean elongation rates. Base temperature for hypocotyl growth of C. melo was estimated as 8.8 °C. The proposed model proved to be useful in calculating and interpreting germination and growth kinetics.},

	abstract = {Metric data are usually assessed on a continuous scale with good precision, but sometimes agricultural researchers cannot obtain precise measurements of a variable. Values of such a variable cannot then be expressed as real numbers (e.g., 1.51 or 2.56), but often can be represented by intervals into which the values fall (e.g., from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 3). In this situation, statisticians talk about censoring and censored data, as opposed to missing data, where no information is available at all. Traditionally, in agriculture and biology, three methods have been used to analyse such data: (a) when intervals are narrow, some form of imputation (e.g., mid-point imputation) is used to replace the interval and traditional methods for continuous data are employed (such as analyses of variance [ANOVA] and regression); (b) for time-to-event data, the cumulative proportions of individuals that experienced the event of interest are analysed, instead of the individual observed times-to-event; (c) when intervals are wide and many individuals are collected, non-parametric methods of data analysis are favoured, where counts are considered instead of the individual observed value for each sample element. In this paper, we show that these methods may be suboptimal: The first one does not respect the process of data collection, the second leads to unreliable standard errors (SEs), while the third does not make full use of all the available information. As an alternative, methods of survival analysis for censored data can be useful, leading to reliable inferences and sound hypotheses testing. These methods are illustrated using three examples from plant and crop sciences.},
