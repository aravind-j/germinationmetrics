	abstract = {A method for mathematically describing cumulative seed germination using the four-parameter Hill function is described. The function's four parameters allowed both direct or indirect biological interpretation of germination behavior and the impact of seed pretreatments on germination improvement. Three parameters, a, b, and c, allowed direct assessment of germination capacity (\%), the shape and steepness of the germination course, and germination speed (time to reach 50\% germination). The fourth parameter y0 permitted estimation of the lag time (germination onset). The mathematical expression of cumulative seed germination of unstratified and stratified seed made it possible to quantitatively estimate seedlot dormancy and the amount of germination improvement caused by a specific seed pretreatment. This was accomplished by estimating the area between the two cumulative germination curves through integration. The utility of the proposed approach was demonstrated using germination data from wind-pollinated, individual genotypes (half-sib families) of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and bulk seedlots of lodgepole pine and white spruce (Picea glauca).},

Leakage of ionic solutes from the seeds did not increase following ageing, but there were considerable increases in losses of small organic molecules. Low temperature pretreatments did not reduce the rate of loss of either amino acids or reducing sugars from aged seeds.

	abstract = {SummaryGermination of Amaranthus caudatus is inhibited by light, far-red being the most effective part of the spectrum. At temperatures of 25° and below there is a low final germination percentage under continuous far-red whereas above 25° there is only a delaying effect. In the presence of a saturating concentration of gibberellic acid (GA3) at 25° seeds germinate under continuous far-red although they are delayed. At 25° seeds exposed to 48 hr far-red fail to germinate when transferred to darkness. This induced dormancy can be broken by a single short exposure to red light given at any time after the far-red illumination. This effect of short red can be reversed by a subsequent short period of far-red indicating that the seeds are phytochrome controlled. Although most seeds have escaped from the reversing effect of short far-red after an intervening dark period of 5 hours, germination is greatly reduced by continuous far-red at this time. Results of exposing seeds to varying periods of far-red before and after dark imbibition are interpreted in terms of a continual production of phytochrome in its active P fr form and a requirement for P fr action over a long period of time. Effects of intermittent and continuous low intensity far-red on the inhibition of germination provides further evidence for a low energy photoreaction involving phytochrome. Effects on Germination Index of continuous illumination with various light sources maintaining different P fr /P total ratios have been investigated. The results suggest that the proportion of phytochrome in the P fr form is the most important factor in the regulation of germination. A scheme for the phytochrome control of germination in Amaranthus caudatus is presented and possible explanations for the dependence on P fr /P total ratio are discussed.},

Stratifying common milkweed seed in water at 5 C was more effective in breaking dormancy than at 22 C. Mechanical scarification also caused a significant increase in germination. Exogenous 6-furfurylamino purine (kinetin) and gibberellic acid-3 (GA) increased germination while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had no effect. The optimum germination temperature scheme for common milkweed was an alternating 20 to 30 C, the maximum between 35 and 40 C, and the minimum between 15 and 20 C. Common milkweed seedlings were more susceptible to moisture stress than kochia [Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.] but less susceptible than hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). In a greenhouse study common milkweed was less drought tolerant than eight other weed species. Common milkweed seedlings tolerated wider pH ranges than honeyvine milkweed [Ampelamus albidus (Nutt.) Britt.], kochia, and sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings were less tolerant to salt solutions than four other species. Common milkweed emerged from 6-cm depths in Sharpsburg silty clay loam (sicl) at 20 or 30 C but only from the 3-cm depth at an alternating 20 to 30 C. Results from root box studies showed that common and honeyvine milkweed produced less shoot and root weight than kochia and sunflower and had a lower growth rate index of roots than sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings resprouted 21 days after planting when clipped at ground level. As days from planting to clipping increased, sprouting activity increased.},

	abstract = {[Investigations have shown that the number of grains of cereals germinating in germination tests is dependent upon the number of pre-germinated corns present, the amount of water added, the temperature of the added water, the temperature of germination, the relative position of the embryo to the level of water, the amount of oxygen present in the germination medium, the level of micro-organism infestation, the presence of dissolved ions in the germination medium, the length of storage at high temperatures and the moisture content of storage. As a result a set of conditions has been defined enabling exactly comparable tests to be made in different laboratories. The measured criteria of the test—the mean and standard deviation of the germination time—have been used for studying varietal differences in germination, for assessment of malting quality, for determining the optimum time for the start of malting, for investigating variety × location inter-actions of malting quality, for vigor studies and for the assessment of milling quality of wheat. This series of investigations has shown that the germination resistance test offers a simple, cheap reproducible method of measuring the germination characteristics of cereals. It has also shown that much useful information regarding the germination of cereals, not normally obtained from germinability tests can be gained. This sensitive technique can thus be used to study the effect of all external agencies on the germination of small grain cereals and with modifications in the moisture supply should also be adaptable to other non-gramineous seeds.]},

	abstract = {Genotypic variation and horticultural potential of Alnus maritima [Marsh.] Nutt. (seaside alder), a large shrub or small tree found naturally in only three small, disjunct populations, have not been studied. We examined effects of population of origin and environment on seed germination and growth and morphology of seedlings. The first experiment showed that 6 weeks of cold stratification optimized germination of half-sibling seeds from Oklahoma at 73.2\%. When this treatment was applied to multiple groups of half-siblings from all populations in a second experiment, seeds from Oklahoma had a higher germination percentage (55.0\%) than seeds from Georgia (31.4\%) and the Delmarva Peninsula (14.7\%). In a third experiment, morphology and growth of multiple groups of half-siblings from all three populations were compared in one environment. Leaves of seedlings from Oklahoma were longer (12.8 cm) and more narrow (2.15 length to width ratio) than leaves of seedlings from Georgia (12.0 cm long; ratio = 1.76) and the Delmarva Peninsula (11.6 cm long; ratio = 1.86). Seedlings from Oklahoma and Georgia accumulated dry weight at higher rates (181 and 160 mg·d-1, respectively) than seedlings from Delmarva (130 mg·d-1), while seedlings from Oklahoma and Delmarva were more densely foliated (0.72 and 0.64 leaves and lateral shoots per centimeter of primary stem, respectively) than those from Georgia (0.46 per cm). These differences indicate genetic divergence among the three disjunct populations and the potential to exploit genetic variation to select horticulturally superior A. maritima for use in managed landscapes.},

We consider experiments where germination in response to time elapsed is used to characterize germination performance and vigour. We formulate statistical models in a biologically meaningful framework in such a way that the inherent data structure, which centers around repeatedly monitoring seeds over time, is duly incorporated in the statistical analysis. Consequently, estimation and model checking procedures are based on treating the data as event times, that is, to record the time it takes for germination (the event of interest) to occur. The key result is that the use of appropriate statistical models is important in order to get a better appreciation of the uncertainty that is present in germination experiments.},
