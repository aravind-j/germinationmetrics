	abstract = {A method for mathematically describing cumulative seed germination using the four-parameter Hill function is described. The function's four parameters allowed both direct or indirect biological interpretation of germination behavior and the impact of seed pretreatments on germination improvement. Three parameters, a, b, and c, allowed direct assessment of germination capacity (\%), the shape and steepness of the germination course, and germination speed (time to reach 50\% germination). The fourth parameter y0 permitted estimation of the lag time (germination onset). The mathematical expression of cumulative seed germination of unstratified and stratified seed made it possible to quantitatively estimate seedlot dormancy and the amount of germination improvement caused by a specific seed pretreatment. This was accomplished by estimating the area between the two cumulative germination curves through integration. The utility of the proposed approach was demonstrated using germination data from wind-pollinated, individual genotypes (half-sib families) of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and bulk seedlots of lodgepole pine and white spruce (Picea glauca).},

Only the second category of physiological damage is reversible: a low temperature pre-sowing treatment being capable of greatly reducing the time to fifty percent germination of both unaged and aged seeds, but having no effect on germination capacity. Leakage of ionic solutes from the seeds did not increase following ageing, but there were considerable increases in losses of small organic molecules. Low temperature pretreatments did not reduce the rate of loss of either amino acids or reducing sugars from aged seeds. The implications of the use of artificial ageing in combination with low temperature pre-sowing treatments in the study of small seed physiology is discussed, as is the value of solute leakage studies in this kind of seed.},

	volume = {85},
	abstract = {SummaryGermination of Amaranthus caudatus is inhibited by light, far-red being the most effective part of the spectrum. At temperatures of 25° and below there is a low final germination percentage under continuous far-red whereas above 25° there is only a delaying effect. In the presence of a saturating concentration of gibberellic acid (GA3) at 25° seeds germinate under continuous far-red although they are delayed. At 25° seeds exposed to 48 hr far-red fail to germinate when transferred to darkness. This induced dormancy can be broken by a single short exposure to red light given at any time after the far-red illumination. This effect of short red can be reversed by a subsequent short period of far-red indicating that the seeds are phytochrome controlled. Although most seeds have escaped from the reversing effect of short far-red after an intervening dark period of 5 hours, germination is greatly reduced by continuous far-red at this time. Results of exposing seeds to varying periods of far-red before and after dark imbibition are interpreted in terms of a continual production of phytochrome in its active P fr form and a requirement for P fr action over a long period of time. Effects of intermittent and continuous low intensity far-red on the inhibition of germination provides further evidence for a low energy photoreaction involving phytochrome. Effects on Germination Index of continuous illumination with various light sources maintaining different P fr /P total ratios have been investigated. The results suggest that the proportion of phytochrome in the P fr form is the most important factor in the regulation of germination. A scheme for the phytochrome control of germination in Amaranthus caudatus is presented and possible explanations for the dependence on P fr /P total ratio are discussed.},

Stratifying common milkweed seed in water at 5 C was more effective in breaking dormancy than at 22 C. Mechanical scarification also caused a significant increase in germination. Exogenous 6-furfurylamino purine (kinetin) and gibberellic acid-3 (GA) increased germination while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had no effect. The optimum germination temperature scheme for common milkweed was an alternating 20 to 30 C, the maximum between 35 and 40 C, and the minimum between 15 and 20 C. Common milkweed seedlings were more susceptible to moisture stress than kochia [Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.] but less susceptible than hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). In a greenhouse study common milkweed was less drought tolerant than eight other weed species. Common milkweed seedlings tolerated wider pH ranges than honeyvine milkweed [Ampelamus albidus (Nutt.) Britt.], kochia, and sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings were less tolerant to salt solutions than four other species. Common milkweed emerged from 6-cm depths in Sharpsburg silty clay loam (sicl) at 20 or 30 C but only from the 3-cm depth at an alternating 20 to 30 C. Results from root box studies showed that common and honeyvine milkweed produced less shoot and root weight than kochia and sunflower and had a lower growth rate index of roots than sunflower. Common milkweed seedlings resprouted 21 days after planting when clipped at ground level. As days from planting to clipping increased, sprouting activity increased.},
