	title = {A new framework for modelling seed germination and seedling tillering of winter wheat in the field},
	abstract = {Abstract
          Aims
 Seed germination is regulated by multiple environmental cues in the field and understanding their relationship is critical to planning seed drilling and subsequent seedling management but challenging due to the trade-off impact of some environmental stimuli on metabolic reactions involved in the germination.
Methods
 We develop a new framework by introducing a physiological dimension over which the metabolic reactions associated with seed germination can be modelled as a moving dynamic event. The influence of environmental cues and the heterogeneity of seeds is described by an average germination rate and a dispersion coefficient. Winter wheat seeds were drilled at different dates in field plots under different soil water contents, and the time course of germination in all treatments and the subsequent tillering development are used to validate the model.
Results
 The model accurately reproduces the time course of germination in all treatments. We find that the average germination rate increases asymptotically rather than linearly as the temperature increases within the base-suboptimal temperature range, and that there is an optimal soil water content at which the germination rate peaks due to the trade-off impact of soil water on seed imbibition and soil anaerobicity. The average germination rate and the dispersion coefficient are closely related.
Conclusions
 Using soil water content instead of matric potential in our model can naturally describe the simultaneous impact of soil water on soil anaerobicity and seed imbibition, and the physiological dimension can be extended to combine seed germination and seedling tillering development as a continued physiological process.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Temperature is a key factor affecting both dormancy and germination. In non-dormant seeds, when temperature is within the thermal range permissive for germination, it just regulates germination velocity, while in seeds presenting dormancy it can also be affecting dormancy level, dormancy termination and the expression of dormancy itself. This dual effect of temperature on dormancy and germination often leads to misinterpretation of obtained germination results and confounds the analysis of temperature effects in seed populations presenting some degree of dormancy. In the present paper we discuss the effect of temperature in the regulation of dormancy level and its implications in dormancy expression, as an attempt to construct a conceptual framework that allows distinguishing between the effects of temperature on dormancy and germination. Finally, we present examples of how a better understanding of these effects could help us to interpret the mixed effects of temperature on both processes during incubation of seeds presenting dormancy.},
