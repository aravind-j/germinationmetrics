Description: Provides functions to compute various germination indices such as
    germinability, median germination time, mean germination time, mean germination rate, speed of
    germination, Timson's index, germination value, coefficient of uniformity of
    germination, uncertainty of germination process, synchrony of germination
    etc. from germination count data. Includes functions for fitting cumulative
    seed germination curves using four-parameter hill function and computation
    of associated parameters. See the vignette for more, including full list of
    citations for the methods implemented.
