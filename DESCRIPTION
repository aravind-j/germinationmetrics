Description: Provides functions to compute various germination indices such as
    germinability, median germination time, mean germination time, mean
    germination rate, speed of germination, Timson's index, germination value,
    coefficient of uniformity of germination, uncertainty of germination
    process, synchrony of germination etc. from germination count data. Includes
    functions for fitting cumulative seed germination curves using
    four-parameter hill function and computation of associated parameters. See
    the vignette for more, including full list of citations for the methods
    implemented.
